### Built with

### What I learned

During the course of this build I learnt about the CSS hsl function which stands for hue, saturation and lightness which is another of putting together colors used for CSS by effecting color's hue, saturation and lightness and this is totally different from the rgb or rgba CSS color functions.
 I also learnt how to style my web page with either using the tag such as body or by using the class or id attributes. I also learnt about the disply most especially the flex display and also how to style block elements.
